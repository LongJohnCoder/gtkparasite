      Hi! Thanks for stopping by!
     </p>
     <p>
      Are you looking for a <em>great</em> tool for
      live-debugging GTK applications? Well that used to be me, but not anymore.
     </p>
     <p>
      See, I've succeeded in infecting GTK itself! That's right, the best parts
      of me now live in GTK as the <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GTK/Inspector?action=show&redirect=Projects%2FGTK%2B%2FInspector">GtkInspector</a>.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rest down here? I'll keep for posterity. To see what my creators
      at <a href="https://www.beanbaginc.com/">Beanbag</a> have been up to
      since my retirement, check out their code and document review tool,
      <a href="https://www.reviewboard.org/">Review Board</a>!

    <p>
     Developing and debugging UIs can be a pain. When something goes wrong,
     it's not always obvious why. You can waste hours writing logging
     statements only to find out that a widget is in the wrong container, or an
     attribute wasn't set correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Developing isn't much better either. Ever spend time writing temporary
     code just to test a new feature, code you know you're going to throw away
     in an hour, and yet you end up spending the next 20 minutes debugging your
     temporary code? Sucks, doesn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
     What your program really needs is a good Parasite infestation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Parasite is a debugging and development tool that runs inside your GTK+
     application's process. It can inspect your application, giving you
     detailed information on your UI, such as the hierarchy, X window IDs,
     widget properties, and more. You can modify properties on the fly in order
     to experiment with the look of your UI.
    </p>
    <p>
     But you can go further than that. You can actually <i>modify</i> your
     application logic while the program is running! Parasite includes an
     embedded Python shell that lets you write new code that directly interacts
     with your application's UI, regardless of the language the application is
     written in. Create new dialogs, attach temporary signal handlers to
     buttons, test out new logic, and gather additional debug information.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you've used <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>, it's
     sort of like that, but for GTK+ applications.
    </p>
    <p>
     Parasite is available under the MIT license.

    <!-- Usage -->
    <a name="usage"></a>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
     Parasite is pretty easy to use. Start off by launching with an application
     by doing the following:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ GTK_MODULES=gtkparasite <i>appname</i>
    </pre>
    <p>
     The Parasite window will pop up immediately, followed by the application
     window.
    </p>
    <p>
     Click the "Inspect" button and then click anywhere in your application's
     UI to load the widget tree for that window and focus in on the selected
     widget. You should then be able to browse around the widget tree.
    </p>
    <p>
     The properties for the selected widget appear on the right-hand side
     of the Parasite window. Many properties can be modified (nearly anything
     other than pointer addresses) by clicking on the property value. You'll
     either be able to type in a new value, or select from a pop-up list.
    </p>
    <p>
     Toggle "Show Graphic Updates" to see debug rectangles any time part of
     your UI redraws. This can be used to help optimize drawing performance
     of a widget.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Python shell is located at the bottom of the screen. It works like
     a standard Python shell. You can import modules you need (such as
     "gtk") and write code to manipulate the widgets.
    </p>
    <p>
     A special "parasite" module is imported for you that provides a
     "gobj" function for converting a pointer address for a widget into
     something you can use in the Python shell. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; widget = parasite.gobj(0xDEADBEEF)
    </pre>
    <p>
     You can get the pointer addresses from the "Pointer Address" column in
     the widget tree, or from right-clicking an item in the widget tree
     and choosing "Send Widget to Shell."
    </p>
    <p>
     You can then use any <a href="http://www.pygtk.org/">PyGTK</a> functions
     on the widget.

    <h3>FAQ</h3>
    <dl class="faq">
     <dd>Why "Parasite?"</dd>
     <dt>Parasite runs inside of another application and allows for
         manipulating the application. We thought the name was appropriate.
         Bonus: We got to create a cute little logo and draw him crawling
         on boxes. Much better t-shirt opportunities.</dt>
     </dt>

     <dd>Will there be t-shirts?</dd>
     <dt>Yes, I think that's something we just have to do.</dt>

     <dd>Why doesn't the Python shell work with GIMP?</dd>
     <dt>GIMP defines a <tt>GtkScaleButton</tt> type that conflicts with
         GTK's own <tt>GtkScaleButton</tt>. This isn't a problem when
         running GIMP itself, since it never uses GTK's, but we use PyGTK
         and that does register GTK's version. This causes a conflict that
         leads to deadlocks. So we had to disable the Python shell. A
         <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=567840">bug report</a>
         has been filed with GIMP on this.</dd>
